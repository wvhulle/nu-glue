# NuShell: Super glue for your operating system

This workshop  will take place on Wed, 2025-12-03, register at [MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/nl-nl/sysghent/events/311799711/). It is meant for tinkerers and engineers who are tired of scripting with Bash.

The workshop consists of an introduction and, alternatingly, a demo and a couple of exercises that participants have to solve.

Experience shows that lots of slides are not helpful for mastering a new language. **Hands-on practice is required** to master any new tool or language.
